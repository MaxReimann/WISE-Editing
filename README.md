# White-box Style Transfer Editing (WISE) Demo

This app demonstrates the editing capabilities of the [White-box Style Transfer Editing (WISE) framework](https://github.com/winfried-ripken/wise).
It optimizes the parameters of classical image processing filters to match a given style image.
After optimization, parameters can be tuned by hand to achieve a desired look.


### How does it work?
We provide a small stylization effect that contains several filters such as bump mapping or edge enhancement that can be optimized. The optimization yields so-called parameter masks, which contain per-pixel parameter settings for each filter.

## ðŸš€ Try it out ðŸš€ 
**Our demo is now on huggingface: [huggingface/Whitebox-Style-Transfer-Editing](https://huggingface.co/spaces/MaxReimann/Whitebox-Style-Transfer-Editing)**

![Streamlit Screenshot](images/screen_wise_demo.jpg?raw=true "WISE Editing Demo")

To run **locally**, clone the repo recursively and install the dependencies in requirements.txt. Set HUGGINGFACE to false in demo_config.py. 
Then run the streamlit app using `streamlit run Whitebox_style_transfer.py`

### Further notes
Pull Requests and further improvements welcome.
Please note that the shown effect is a minimal pipeline in terms of stylization capability, the much more feature-rich oilpaint and watercolor pipelines we show in our ECCV paper cannot be open-sourced due to IP reasons.
